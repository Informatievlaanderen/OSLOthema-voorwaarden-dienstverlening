CCCEV recommends to not use the Requirement class directly, but rather a more semantically-enriched subclass such as Criterion, Information Requirement or Constraint. Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for a specific Agent.   The European Directive on services in the internal market  defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy."@en ;

<http://data.europa.eu/m8g/SupportedValue>
    <http://purl.org/vocab/vann/usageNote> """The notion of Supported Value is closely related to actual data exchange between two parties: 
(a) the Requirement processor, i.e. the Agent setting out Requirements for an objective and processing the supplied Evidences in the context of the Requirements, and 
(b) the Evidence provider, i.e. the Agent supplying information to an information request expressed as Requirements.

The Requirement processor has expressed its expectations (both business as technical) for the information it wants to recieve as an Information Concept. The Evidence provider is able to supply information for that Information Concept, but its native data representation might not be coherent with the expectations set by the Requirement processor. The Supported Value is bridging both. 

The Evidence provider can either provide a derived value (fact) from its native data representation that complies with the Information Concept expectations. Or it can provide a query in an agreed language between Evidence provider and Requirement processor that allows the Requirement processor to retrieve the value from the native data representation.

Implementers are free to choose their language. It is recommended to document the made agreements well.

<http://data.europa.eu/m8g/expressionOfExpectedValue>
    <http://purl.org/vocab/vann/usageNote> """The property encapsulates all kind of expectations on the required and provided values one could have. 
This may range from representational expectations such as the type (e.g. the value is expected to be a xsd:decimal) to expectations that reduce the allowed value range. Commonly this is done using min or max bounderary expressions (e.g. the maximum value is 1 Million Euro).
Other usage could be to harmonise the supplied values (e.g. rounding, turning to percentages) to facilitate further processing.

Implementers are free to use their own approach for defining the expected values in more details. For instance, this can be by defining their own datatypes extending or encapsulating common xsd datatypes. But also by using more complex languages such as XPath, Object Constraint Language (OCL), JavaScript and Rule Interchange Format (RIF).
Because of this freedom, implementers are recommended to well-document their usage of this property (and related information).
